# Human-Sentiment
Jupyter Notebook implementing product review sentiment analysis using text preprocessing, TF-IDF features, and an LSTM neural network with a simple Gradio interface.

## Summary
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating sentiment analysis on product reviews using Natural Language Processing and deep learning techniques.

## Code Description
The notebook performs text preprocessing using NLTK, converts review text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, and trains an LSTM-based neural network to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The trained model is evaluated on test data, and a simple interactive interface is created using Gradio to predict sentiment for user-entered reviews.
